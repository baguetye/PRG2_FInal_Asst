# PRG2_FInal_Asst
A C# Object-Oriented Program (OOP) designed to manage customer orders at a robotic ice cream store. Features include customer registration, order processing, modifications, loyalty rewards, and priority queues for gold-tier members. Uses CSV file handling and queue management to simulate a real-world ordering system.
Features

✔ Customer Registration – New customers are automatically enrolled in the rewards program.

✔ Order Processing – Customers can create and modify ice cream orders with different options.

✔ Membership & Loyalty System – Tracks customer purchases and applies rewards such as birthday discounts, point redemptions, and free ice cream rewards.

✔ Priority Queue for Gold Members – Orders from gold-tier members are processed first.

✔ Sales Report Generation – Displays a breakdown of monthly and yearly revenue.

Technologies Used
- C# with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- CSV File Handling for customer and order data management
- Queue Management for processing customer orders
- Data Validation & Error Handling for reliable system performance

This project applies OOP design principles, structured programming, and real-world business logic to simulate an automated ice cream shop, enhancing skills in data processing, system architecture, and C# programming.
